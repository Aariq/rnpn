I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 4.0.2 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and
R 4.0.2 on Windows 10.

This is major update from the previous version.

Thanks! Lee Marsh
