# `rnpn`

`rnpn` is a set of functions/package is an R interface to the US National Phenology Network API. 

National Phenology Network API documentation here:

Note that there is no need for an API key to grab data from the National Phenology Network, but I think there is for writing data through the API. Currently, functions in this package only allow getting data, but will soon allow posting data to the USNPN endpoints.
