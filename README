NOTE THAT YOU CAN NOT USE THIS AS A PACKAGE VIA LIBRARY() OR REQUIRE() AS OF YET, BUT WE ARE WORKING ON GETTING THERE. 



This set of functions/package is an R interface to the National Phenology Network API. 


National Phenology Network API documentation here:

Note that there is no need for an API key to grab data from the National Phenology Network, but I think there is for writing data through the API. But the functions written in this package are only for grabbing data.
