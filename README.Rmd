`rnpn` is an R client for the US National Phenology Network API.

National Phenology Network [API documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNjupricKOAXn6tY1sI7-EwkcfwdGUZ7lxYv7fcPjO8/edit?hl=en_US).

Note that there is no need for an API key to grab data from the National Phenology Network, but I think there is for writing data through the API. Currently, functions in this package only allow getting data, but may at some point allow posting data to the USNPN.

## Quick start

### Installation

Note: Windows users installing from GitHub should get Rtools - can be installed from http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnpn")
```

```{r}
library('rnpn')
```

### Lookup names

You can lookup taxon names. This is not actually an API call to the web. The function simply searches for matches in a dataset stored in the package. You can then use the speciesid output in other functions.

```{r}
lookup_names(name='Pinus', type='genus')
```

### Search

Search for a single species, specifying a start and end date. You can also pass a vector to the speciesid parameter.

```{r}
(out <- npn_allobssp(speciesid = 52, startdate='2008-01-01', enddate='2010-12-31'))
```

Coerce data to a data.frame that has most all data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# hmm, this doesn't work
npn_todf(out)
```

### List stations with xyz

Get a list of all stations which have an individual whom is a member of a set of species.

```{r}
head( npn_stationswithspp(speciesid = 53) )
```

### Stations by state

Number of stations by state.

```{r}
head( npn_stationsbystate() )
```

### Observations by day

Get observations by day for a particular species or set of species.

```{r tidy=FALSE, fig.width=10}
library('plyr')
temp <- lookup_names(name='bird', type='common')
comnames <- as.character(temp[temp$species_id %in% c(357, 359, 1108), 'common_name'])

out <- npn_obsspbyday(speciesid=c(357, 359, 1108), startdate='2010-04-01', enddate='2013-09-31')
names(out) <- comnames
df <- ldply(out)
df$date <- as.Date(df$date)

library('ggplot2')
ggplot(df, aes(date, count)) +
 geom_line() +
 theme_grey(base_size=20) +
 facet_grid(.id ~.)
```

### Search for species

All species

```{r}
head( npn_species() )
```

By ITIS taxonomic serial number

```{r}
npn_species_itis(ids = 27806)
```

By USNPN id

```{r}
npn_species_id(ids = 3)
```

By state (and optionally kingdom)

```{r}
head( npn_species_state(state = "HI", kingdom = "Plantae") )
```

By scientific name

```{r}
npn_species_sci(genus = "Clintonia", species = "borealis")
```

By common name

```{r}
npn_species_comm(name = "thickleaved wild strawberry")
```

Filter by network, group, year, or station

```{r}
head( npn_species_search(groups = 3, year = 2010) )
```
